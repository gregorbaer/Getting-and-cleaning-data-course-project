# Getting and cleaning data - course project

This repository shows the work done for the final project of the course "Getting
and cleaning data" which is part of the Data science specialization taught by
John Hopkins, made available on Coursera.The aim of the project was to demonstrate that the student is able to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data contains measurements of human activity recognition through wearing a smartphone. The original data and a full description of the data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

#### In this repository you find the following files:  
- **run_analysis.R** contains the script used to merge the training and test
data, clean the data, and produce a new tidy data set.  
- **tidy_avgs.csv** contains the new tidy data set which shows the averages of
all measurements of the standard deviations and means of the original variables 
included in the data.  
- **CodeBook.md** describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and
work that was performed to clean the data.
